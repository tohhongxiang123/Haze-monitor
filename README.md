## Air Quality Monitoring Website
Demo [here](https://singapore-air-quality.herokuapp.com/)

With the recent hazy conditions in Singapore, this website was made to monitor the air quality of the island.

Data pulled from [Singapore's PSI API](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/psi) provided under the [Singapore Open Data Licence](https://data.gov.sg/open-data-licence)

Data visualised using [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
